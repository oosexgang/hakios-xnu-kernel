# Run every texture shader of the corpus and check the texel it returns.
#
# air_run binds a texture whose texel (x, y, z) is (100+x, 200+y, 300+x+y+z, 400) --
# 4x4 for a 2D sampler, 4x4x4 for a 3D one, because a 3D sample out of a 2D
# texture can come back right by accident and that is not evidence --
# a nearest sampler with clamped addressing, and a coordinate at the centre of
# texel (1, 1). A shader that samples or fetches once must therefore return
# exactly 101 201 302 400 -- an equality, not a tolerance: nearest filtering at
# a texel centre has no weights to round and clamping has no arithmetic.
#
# What this does NOT check is anything that depends on Metal's own sampler
# state: the two modules of the corpus that declare a `constexpr sampler`
# carry it as a 64-bit word that is not decoded (docs/air.md). Here the API
# chooses the sampler, so what is verified is the texture operation and not
# Apple's filtering or addressing.
#
# A shader that combines several samples, or scales the coordinate, will not
# return the bare texel; those are listed as "other" with what they did return,
# which is a thing to read rather than a failure.
#
# usage: texcheck.sh [FILE.metallib ...]
