# Fetch what Sileo needs into jb/ (never in the repository, like fw-*): the Procursus bootstrap for
# iOS and the Sileo package, both for arm64 and both "rootless" -- everything under /var/jb.
#
# Rootless is what fits this port: / is an APFS image that cannot be written to, and /private/var
# is the only writable filesystem there is (a memory filesystem, made afresh at every boot), so the
# whole prefix has to live under /var. The binaries of the rootless distribution are built for
# iOS 15 and up (dpkg 1.22.6, apt 2.9.4) and Sileo for iOS 11 and up; the "1800" in the path is the
# name of the distribution, not a demand for iOS 18.
#
# What is left behind in jb/:
#   root/var/jb/...      the bootstrap with Sileo unpacked into it, as the phone will have it
#   debs/                the packages it was made of, for a look
# userland/build.sh puts root/var/jb into the system image (as /jb, read only) and init copies it
# to /private/var/jb at every boot.
