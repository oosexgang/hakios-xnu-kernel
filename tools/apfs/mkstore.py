"""Build the store volume: an APFS container whose root holds the fixed-length slot files.

The kernel's APFS driver reads and does not write, and making a file is a transaction (see
bsd/miscfs/apfs/apfs_store.c and tools/apfs/txn-probe.py for what one costs).  So the volume is
made here, once, by the same program that makes every other image this port uses -- mkapfs.py --
and from then on nothing ever changes its structure again: only the bytes inside the slot files
are overwritten, where they lie, by apfs_write_in_place().  That is the whole reason this idea
does not fold back into needing a writable APFS, and the price of it is this one step on a
computer.

The slots are pre-allocated to their full length, so each is one extent with no hole in it --
a hole would mean allocating a block, which is the thing we are avoiding.  They are stored
uncompressed for the same reason: a compressed file keeps its bytes somewhere else entirely and
apfs_write_in_place refuses one.

usage: mkstore.py -o IMAGE [--slot-bytes N] [--slots N] [--dense]
  --slot-bytes N   how long each slot is; N may end in K, M or G (default 256M)
  --slots N        how many (default 2: the two-slot discipline needs exactly two, and more are
                   only for testing what the code does with them)
  --dense          do not dig the zero blocks back out of the image file afterwards

The image is a whole container and goes onto the flash as one: into the free space of the
partition darwin, past the blocks the loader and the kernel both refuse to write before
(BLOCK_WRITE_FIRST / UFS_WRITE_FIRST, block 2042368).  Writing it there is a once-only step from
Android with tools/darwin-write.py and it destroys whatever the store held before, so the image
is made once and kept.

Check it as any other image is checked: tools/apfs/check-image.sh IMAGE RedwoodStore=DIR, and
`apfs-tool store info IMAGE` says whether the driver will have it.
