/* Metal's fmod: the remainder of x/y, with the SIGN OF x, correctly rounded.
 *
 * nir_frem is not that function. Its constant expression is, literally,
 *
 *     src0 - src1 * truncf(src0 / src1)                (nir_opcodes.py)
 *
 * and ir3 lowers it to the same three instructions (ir3_compiler.c sets
 * .lower_fmod). Two things are wrong with the formula, and
 * tools/air/intrincheck.py counted both: of 264 cases of air.fmod.f32 it
 * reported 47 wrong, 25 of them a sign and 22 of them a number.
 *
 *   - THE SIGN OF A ZERO IS LOST. fmod(-0, 5) is -0 and fmod(-1.5, 0.5) is
 *     -0, and the subtraction gives +0 for both: -0 - (0.5 * -0) is -0 - -0,
 *     which is +0. This is the shape of the air.sign bug recorded further
 *     down this file -- a sign of zero that a formula does not carry -- and
 *     it is the half of this that is not about precision at all.
 *   - THE PRODUCT IS ROUNDED BEFORE THE SUBTRACTION. y * trunc(x/y) needs up
 *     to 48 significant bits and a float has 24, so the subtraction is exact
 *     but of the wrong product: fmod(1.5, 0x1.fffffep-2) came out 1.19e-07
 *     against 8.94e-08, one whole ulp of the dividend, and fmod(1e8, 3) came
 *     out 0 where the answer is 1. A number, not a sign.
 *
 * Whose definition is followed here, and why it is Metal's: the Metal Shading
 * Language Specification's table entry for fmod gives the same subtraction
 * formula, but it inherits OpenCL's accuracy table along with it, where fmod
 * is 0 ULP -- an exactly specified function, not a licensed approximation --
 * and OpenCL's edge cases are C99 Annex F's, which say fmod(+-0, y) is +-0.
 * Two references on this machine agree with that reading and none with the
 * formula: this machine's libm answers -0 for fmodf(-0, 0.5) and for
 * fmodf(-1.5, 0.5), and LLVM's own `frem` -- JIT-executed by lli, which is
 * the second engine and not a reading of a document -- answers -0 for both
 * and for frem(-2.5, -0.5). The corpus itself says nothing either way: not
 * one of its 128 libraries contains a single `frem` instruction, because
 * Apple's compiler always emits the call.
 *
 * So:
 *
 *   q = trunc(x / y)
 *   r = fma(-y, q, x)        one rounding, not two
 *   if (|r| >= |y|)   r -= copysign(|y|, r)      q was one too small
 *   if (sign r != sign x) r += copysign(|y|, x)  q was one too large
 *   if (r == 0)       r  = copysign(0, x)        a zero keeps x's sign
 *
 * The fma is the whole of the precision argument: when q is an exact integer
 * the true remainder x - q*y is itself exactly representable (that is why
 * IEEE 754 can require `remainder` to be exact), so ONE rounding of it is no
 * rounding at all. The two corrections are there because fl(x/y) can round
 * across an integer and move trunc by one either way, and because ir3 does
 * not divide: it lowers fdiv to fmul(a, frcp(b)) and frcp is approximate, so
 * a quotient off by one has to be survivable rather than assumed away.
 *
 * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT DO, measured and not guessed: q must be exactly
 * representable, which means |x/y| < 2^24 for a float and 2^11 for a half.
 * Above that no correction of a bounded size can help -- fmod(1e8, 1e-8)
 * wants a quotient of 1e16 -- and the exact answer needs an iterated
 * reduction: scale y up by 2^k so the partial quotient stays under 2^23,
 * subtract, repeat. Each pass removes only 23 - 1 bits of the exponent
 * difference, that difference reaches 253 for two normal floats, so twelve
 * passes of about ten instructions each would be the price, and its exactness
 * ON THE ADRENO could not be established from this machine at all for the
 * frcp reason above. It is not done here; section 4 of docs/air.md carries
 * the condition and the measurement.
 *
 * Over the reference pool this leaves 7 of 264 cases differing, every one of
 * them with |x/y| >= 2^24; over 195 906 random pairs of normal floats every
 * single disagreement with this machine's libm has |x/y| >= 2^24, and over
 * 376 438 random pairs whose quotient IS representable there is none.

/* -- fragment flow control ---------------------------------------------- */

/* air.discard_fragment()
 *
 * NIR'S `demote` AND NOT NIR'S `terminate`, and that choice is the whole of
 * this function. The two differ in what the thread does afterwards: terminate
 * ends the invocation, so the lane stops contributing to its quad's
 * derivatives and performs no further memory writes, while demote turns it
 * into a HELPER invocation -- it keeps executing, its framebuffer and memory
 * writes are dropped, and it still supplies the neighbour values that a
 * derivative or an implicit-level-of-detail sample in the OTHER three lanes
 * of the quad needs.
 *
 * It is a real distinction in NIR and in every backend that has one: ir3
 * keeps the two apart in its own IR (ir3_compiler_nir.c emits ir3_DEMOTE
 * against ir3_KILL, and they carry different scheduling barriers), and
 * nir_to_tgsi sends them to TGSI's DEMOTE and KILL, which are separate
 * opcodes. ONE PLACE COLLAPSES THEM, AND IT IS WORTH KNOWING ABOUT: the a6xx
 * instruction encoder maps DEMOTE onto the hardware's KILL --
 * `} else if (instr->opc == OPC_DEMOTE) { return OPC_KILL; }` in
 * src/freedreno/isa/encode.c -- and the ISA description has no demote bitset
 * at all (ir3-cat0.xml carries `kill` and nothing beside it). So on this GPU,
 * with this Mesa, both come out as one instruction and the helper lanes Metal
 * promises are not delivered by the hardware path today. That is a gap to
 * name, not a reason to translate this as `terminate`: terminate would lose
 * the same lanes and would be wrong on a backend that does tell them apart.
 * What it costs is measurable only on the phone -- a shader that discards and
 * then takes a derivative -- and that is written as a job rather than assumed.
 *
 * ONE THING IS NOT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO, and saying so is the
 * correction of a sentence that used to stand here: stores. NIR's own
 * definition of demote (nir_intrinsics.py) is "Any stores to memory after
 * this instruction are suppressed and the fragment does not write outputs to
 * the framebuffer. Unlike discard, demote needs to ensure that derivatives
 * will still work for invocations that were not demoted." So demote drops the
 * lane's later writes as well -- it differs from terminate in the derivatives
 * and in the lane going on executing, not in the memory. Whether METAL drops
 * them is a third question, and nothing on this machine answers it: no header
 * on the device says, and a corpus cannot show it. If Metal keeps them, both
 * of NIR's intrinsics are wrong about it by the same amount.
 *
 * Nothing in a corpus COUNT can decide it -- both translate, both validate,
 * both compile -- so it is decided from two independent readings of what
 * Metal means, and both say the thread lives:
 *
 *  1. The shaders themselves. Resident Evil 4's `PS_DrawByTiles` calls
 *     air.discard_fragment at the ninth instruction of a 1 800-line function
 *     and then calls `air.simd_is_helper_thread()` EIGHT TIMES further down
 *     it. A terminated thread cannot be asked whether it is a helper thread;
 *     a demoted one answers yes, which is the only reading under which that
 *     shader means anything. 24 of the library's 1 288 discard-calling modules
 *     call that function.
 *  2. Apple's own declaration of it. `llvm-dis` of that module reads
 *     `declare void @air.discard_fragment() local_unnamed_addr #8` with
 *     `attributes #8 = { nounwind }` -- and NOT `noreturn`. LLVM is entitled
 *     to delete everything after a call it is told does not return, and
 *     Apple's compiler kept the rest of the function; the call is followed by
 *     `br` and not `unreachable` in 73 of 85 call sites sampled. A discard
 *     that killed the thread would be a noreturn call.
 *
 * And the cost of getting it wrong is not hypothetical here: of 85 sampled
 * call sites, 45 are followed in the same function by an air.sample_* with an
 * implicit level of detail and 6 by air.dfdx, both of which read the other
 * lanes of the quad. Under `terminate` those neighbours would read a dead
 * lane.
 *
 * uses_discard is set by hand because nir_shader_gather_info does not run on
 * this path (ir3 calls it only for a binning variant), exactly as the
 * framebuffer-fetch flags are set in air_to_nir.c. It is not bookkeeping: it
 * is what nir_to_tgsi_info turns into `uses_kill`, which is what a Gallium
 * driver reads before it allows an early depth test, and what freedreno reads
 * before it writes LRZ. A discarding shader whose interface says it discards
 * nothing gets its depth written for pixels it threw away.

/* air.simd_* and air.quad_*: Metal's cross-lane operations.
 *
 * THE SIMD-GROUP HERE IS THE IMPLEMENTATION'S, NOT A 32-LANE ONE, and that is
 * the only way these can be translated honestly. Metal does not fix the width
 * -- a shader asks for it with air.get_simd_width (this file answers with
 * nir_load_subgroup_size) and a host asks MTLComputePipelineState for
 * threadExecutionWidth -- and it is 32 on every Apple GPU, which is why a
 * shader compiled for one may have the number built into it. This hardware's
 * is 64 or 128: `threadsize_base` is 64 for the A635 this port targets and ir3
 * doubles it per variant in the compute and fragment stages
 * (ir3_shader_get_subgroup_size, IR3_SINGLE_OR_DOUBLE).
 *
 * So the width a translated shader is TOLD and the width its votes are taken
 * over are the same number, whatever that number is: a shader that reads
 * air.get_simd_width and works from it is right, and a shader with 32 written
 * into it is wrong -- as it would be on any Metal implementation whose
 * SIMD-group is not 32 wide. Each of these leaves a note saying so, because it
 * is a thing the hardware cannot do exactly rather than a thing this frontend
 * chose.
 *
 * One more thing decides whether that consistency holds, and it is a property
 * of the GPU and not of this file: ir3 declares a fragment or vertex
 * subgroup to be ONE LANE and lowers a vote to its own argument on a device
 * without `has_getfiberid` (ir3_nir.c: `options.subgroup_size = 1`,
 * `lower_vote_trivial`). The A635 has it -- it is an a6xx gen4, and
 * freedreno_devices.py sets the flag for gen4 and above -- so the votes here
 * are real in every stage, and air.get_simd_width answers with the real width
 * in the same stages. On an a6xx below gen4 both would read 1, which is still
 * self-consistent and still not Metal's 32.
 *
 * air.simd_ballot is the one that cannot be translated at all, and it is
 * refused by name below rather than noted: its result is a 64-bit mask with
 * one bit per lane, and a lane count this frontend cannot bound at 64. A
 * popcount of a truncated mask is a smaller number and not a worse one.
 *
 * The QUAD operations are a different matter and are exact: a quad is four
 * consecutive lanes on both machines -- it is what a fragment derivative is
 * computed over -- so a swap inside one has the same meaning whatever the
 * SIMD-group's width is, and nir_lower_subgroups leaves the quad intrinsics
 * alone for ir3 (no lower_quad, and lower_vote_trivial does not reach them).

/* -- textures ------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The largest family and the one with the long tail. Its vocabulary is
 * Apple's, read off AGXCompilerCore the same way the arithmetic was
 * (docs/air.md section 3.2): the names there end in an underscore --
 * air.sample_texture_, air.gather_compare_depth_, air.get_num_mip_levels_texture_
 * -- because the dimensionality is appended to them. That is why the earlier
 * survey counted "about 117 get_*_texture_* variants": it is some twenty
 * operations crossed with nine dimensionalities, not a hundred separate
 * things.
 *
 * The signatures are measured from the corpus, not guessed:
 *
 *   sample_<kind>_<dim> (tex, samp, [plane,] coord, [i32 array,]
 *                        [i1 has_offset, offset,]
 *                        i1 lod_is_level, float lod_or_bias, float min_lod,
 *                        i32 flags)                  -> { <4 x T>, i8 }
 *   sample_<kind>_<dim>_grad
 *                       (tex, samp, [plane,] coord, [i32 array,]
 *                        dPdx, dPdy, float min_lod,
 *                        [i1 has_offset, offset,] i32 flags)
 *   gather_<kind>_<dim> (tex, samp, coord, [i32 array,]
 *                        [i1 has_offset, offset,]
 *                        i32 component, i32 flags)   -> { <4 x T>, i8 }
 *   read_<kind>_<dim>   (tex, [plane,] coord, [i32 array,]
 *                        i32 lod_or_sample, i32 flags)
 *   write_<kind>_<dim>  (tex, coord, [i32 array,] value, i32 lod, i32 flags)
 *   get_<what>_<kind>_<dim> (tex[, i32 lod])         -> i32
 *
 * Three things in those brackets, and none of them is a guess. They are read
 * off Apple's own metal_stdlib on this device --
 * GPUCompiler.framework/.../include/metal/metal_texture, where every
 * `texture2d_array<T>::sample` and its fifty neighbours are one-line
 * forwarders to the builtin, so the header states the argument ORDER for all
 * nine dimensionalities and six operations -- and then confirmed against the
 * LLVM declaration in the modules that call them. The two agree everywhere:
 *
 *   AN ARRAY INDEX IS ITS OWN ARGUMENT, straight after the coordinate, in
 *   every one of sample, gather, read and write. It is not inside the
 *   coordinate vector, which is what this file used to require of it:
 *   air.sample_texture_2d_array takes a <2 x float> and an i32, and the
 *   refusal it used to earn said "with a 2-component coordinate, wanting 3".
 *
 *   THE GRADIENT FORM REORDERS WHAT FOLLOWS. dPdx, dPdy and the minimum level
 *   come before the offset pair, where the plain form has the offset pair
 *   first and the level last. A reader that assumed one order for both would
 *   take a gradient for an offset flag.
 *
 *   A CUBE HAS NO OFFSET PAIR AT ALL -- Metal defines no offset for cube
 *   sampling -- so air.sample_texture_cube goes from the coordinate straight
 *   to the level flag. Reading the 2d shape there is what made 621 modules
 *   stop at "argument 5 is not a constant": the float minimum level was being
 *   read as the i1 that says whether the next float is a level.
 *
 * The i1 before the level is read as "the float is a level, not a bias", so
 * (false, 0.0) is a plain sample -- which is what every one of the system
 * corpus's sample calls passes. Resident Evil 4 exercises both: 23 823
 * level-form calls against 5 961 bias-form.
 *
 * The second field of the returned struct is Metal's sparse-residency byte.
 * No module in the corpus reads it (every extractvalue of a texture result
 * takes field 0), so it is produced as zero rather than invented.
