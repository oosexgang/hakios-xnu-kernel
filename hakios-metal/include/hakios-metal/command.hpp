// Metal's command model on the GPU: a queue, the command buffers committed to it in order, and the blit work the
// command processor can do on its own. It is what MTLCommandQueue, MTLCommandBuffer and MTLBlitCommandEncoder are
// in the plug-in (objc/), and it is testable without them.
//
//   CommandQueue        a submission queue of the driver's own; its command buffers complete in commit order, and
//                       a thread of its own waits for their fences and runs their completed handlers in that order
//   CommandBuffer       Metal's states (not enqueued, enqueued, committed, scheduled, completed, error); its
//                       packets go into a buffer of the queue's (returned to the queue once the GPU is done with it)
//   BlitEncoder         copy and fill of buffers, by the command processor: CP_MEMCPY and CP_MEM_WRITE (pm4.hpp).
//                       Offsets and lengths are in bytes and must be multiples of 4: the command processor moves
//                       words. Metal on macOS asks the same of copies; a blit that is not aligned is refused with
//                       the reason, and the command buffer ends in the error state, as Metal's does on a bad blit.
