/*
 * libhakios.dylib: code of ours inside stock Darwin programs.
 *
 * launchd starts the jobs named in INJECT (see build.sh / mkjobs.py) with
 * DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES pointing here; dyld honours that because the kernel's AMFI stand-in
 * says so. What is done depends on the program:
 *
 *   backboardd   the window server (CoreAnimation in QuartzCore). There is no GPU, so the
 *                render server must use CoreAnimation's own software rasterizer, and we want to
 *                see why a frame is or is not drawn. The C++ objects are reached by replacing
 *                entries of their virtual tables.
 *                It is also where input enters the system: backboardd is the HID event server,
 *                and without Apple's multitouch driver it has no touch screen. We give it one:
 *                a "virtual" HID service that turns the samples of /dev/hakios-touch into the
 *                events that driver would have sent.
 *
 *                And it does not wait five seconds for an ambient light sensor.
 *
 *   containermanagerd (both of them)
 *                They ask the user manager for the "personas" of the user, of which this
 *                system has none, twenty times a second apart before they give up -- and
 *                everything that needs a container (the window server, for one) waits with
 *                them. Told that personas are not supported, they do not ask.
 *
 * Addresses of things inside the dyld shared cache are those of Darwin userland 16.5 (20F66) for iPhone10,3;
 * every one is checked against what is expected to be there before it is touched.

 * CoreAnimation's OpenGL ES renderer keeps the source of one fragment shader per function in a
 * table of its own -- unslid 0x1d5b54790, indexed by the function's number -- and the functions it
 * has no shader for are null entries there. That is the whole of "the renderer has no function
 * 40": GLContext::create_shader takes the source from that table, and function_supported answers
 * from the same place. Made to answer yes without the entry, create_shader hands the null to
 * strdup and the window server dies in strlen, which is what glyes=40 did for a whole afternoon.
 *
 * So the way to give the renderer a function is to give it a source. "sb3" (40) is the single
 * pass of a blur -- GaussianBlurFilter::render -> Context::blur_surface ->
 * BlurState::single_pass_blur -- the one that lays the shadow under a card of the switcher of
 * running applications. It is given the same four places as "ds4" (26) and has no weights of its
 * own, so this is ds4's own shader with the weights taken out, in the dialect the others are
 * written in (sampler2DRect, varying, gl_FragData -- the preamble is added by the renderer).
 *
 * Where this stands. With the entry filled the window server no longer dies: thirty-odd crashes a
 * run become none, with glyes=40 as well, and the function really is drawn -- the renderer rewrites
 * our source into its own dialect (sampler2DRect becomes sampler2D) and compiles it, and the
 * picture changes by a level or two across the whole screen where before it did not change at all.
 *
 * What it does not do is bring back a shadow, and the reason is that none was missing. This
 * function was taken up because a note here said the shadow under a card of the switcher was not
 * drawn; that note was reasoning from "the function is refused", not an observation. Against the
 * same frame drawn by CoreAnimation's software renderer -- which draws everything correctly, only
 * slowly -- the edge of a card is the same to the level: 18, 17, 17, then the card. There is no
 * soft falloff there in either, so there is nothing of that kind to restore.
 *
 * Its effect is nil for a second reason worth writing down: the four places reach the shader as
 * varyings that a vertex shader computes from "uniform highp vec2 offset[4]", and the two groups
 * of four numbers function_uniform delivers for it are of the order of 5e-19 -- zero, for a
 * blur. CoreAnimation asks for the single-pass blur exactly when the radius is too small to need
 * the multi-pass one, so the four samples coincide and the pass copies what it was given.
