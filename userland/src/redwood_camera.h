/*
 * /dev/redwood-camera: the phone's wide camera for iOS (boot-arg cam=5; the kernel's bsd/dev/redwood_camera.c,
 * whose bsd/sys/redwood_camera.h this is a copy of).
 *
 *   open()   the first one powers the sensor up and starts its frames (the sensor's mode: boot-arg
 *            cam_mode, else the module file's 4000x3000 one); the last close puts everything down
 *            again, and so does a second without a read.
 *   read()   waits (at most a second) for the newest frame not read yet: a struct
 *            redwood_camera_frame, then as many of the frame's bytes as the buffer has room for.
 *            A buffer of the header's size learns the frame's size and nothing else is copied.
 *            EIO when the camera has had a fault: it stays off for the rest of the run.
 *   write()  commands: a struct redwood_camera_command, then what it says follows.
