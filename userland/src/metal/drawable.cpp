/*
 * An IOSurface of CoreAnimation's, as a texture of this driver.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, in one measurement. Showing a frame on this port costs 15.46 ms
 * (docs/metal.md 10.43): -getBytes: pulls a finished attachment into the process (11.96 ms,
 * 867 MB/s) and kRedwoodShow pushes it into the kernel (3.50 ms, 2962 MB/s). That is a
 * ceiling of 64.7 frames a second with nothing drawn, and about twelve of those
 * milliseconds exist for one reason only: there is nowhere else to put the picture. A
 * drawable is that somewhere else -- memory the display controller already scans out -- and
 * both copies go away, not get faster.
 *
 * WHAT COREANIMATION ACTUALLY ASKS FOR, read out of this phone's own cache (every address
 * below is in docs/metal.md 10.46 with what it was read from). -[CAMetalLayer nextDrawable]
 * (0x18829de60) ends in get_unused_drawable (0x18837cff8), which makes the surface itself
 * with CA::Render::create_iosurface_with_pixel_format (0x18833cfa8) and then calls
 * allocate_drawable_texture (0x1884b3470). That function sends a device exactly one message:
 *
 *     -newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:   (0x1885c3060)
 *
 * with a plain MTLTextureDescriptor it has just built, the surface, and plane 0. Everything
 * else on that path is Apple's or CoreAnimation's: the descriptor's private setters
 * (-setRotation:, -setIsDrawable:, -setFramebufferOnly:, -setUsage:, -setResourceIndex:) are
 * all MTLTextureDescriptorInternal's own, and presentation never comes near a device at all
 * -- register_drawable (0x18838692c) hands the surface to the layer's CAImageQueue with
 * CAImageQueueRegisterIOSurfaceBuffer and -[CAMetalDrawable present] inserts the buffer id
 * into that queue. So the whole of what this port owes a drawable is the one method.
 *
 * AND THAT METHOD HAS FOUR OTHER CALLERS, which the first boot of this file found out the
 * hard way. A scan of QuartzCore's __text for BL to the selector stub finds five sites; the
 * four that are not allocate_drawable_texture are the window server's Metal compositor:
 * CA::OGL::MetalContext::set_destination_iosurface (0x188302550), ::update_surface
 * (0x1883163e0), ::get_surface (0x18833e724) and ::create_surface_from_iosurface
 * (0x18835e55c). They composite whatever surface a client gave the window server, so they
 * ask for formats no CAMetalLayer may hold -- backboardd asked 55 times in one boot for
 * MTLPixelFormat 500, which is MTLPixelFormatYCBCR8_420_2P. Three of the four pass plane 0
 * unconditionally; ::update_surface passes a plane variable (csel x4 at 0x1883163d8), so the
 * compositor does per-plane imports when it gets that far. This file therefore serves "a
 * texture over an IOSurface" for whoever asks, and refuses what one linear plane cannot be.
 *
 * HOW THE MEMORY GETS HERE. Four layers, and all four now exist:
 *
 *   the kernel     kRedwoodSurface (0x7e) turns an IOSurface into a GPU buffer and reports
 *                  its size, offset, row length and geometry (RedwoodGPU.cpp:821)
 *   the DRM shim   drmPrimeFDToHandle(fd, surface_id, &handle) -- the ID goes where Linux
 *                  puts a dmabuf descriptor (tools/mesa/redwood-drm/redwood_drm.c:189)
 *   freedreno      fd_bo_from_dmabuf_drm takes it ("what comes in here is an IOSurface, and
 *                  the file descriptor its ID"), and fd_resource_from_handle lays a resource
 *                  over it with one pitch
 *   the contract   rwa_texture_from_surface (tools/mesa/air/air_metal.h)
 *
 * The last of those is new, and it is still looked up rather than linked: an image built
 * before it existed has a library without the symbol, and then this file refuses BY NAME
 * instead of returning a bare nil. That distinction is not tidiness -- get_unused_drawable
 * does NOT test the texture it gets back (no branch between the call at 0x18837d220 and the
 * store at 0x18837d224), so a nil here becomes a CAMetalDrawable whose -texture is nil, and
 * the application finds out later, somewhere else, as an assertion about a nil colour
 * attachment. A sentence at the moment of the refusal names what was missing.
 *
 * WHO OWNS THE BUFFER, because this was wrong once. The buffer the kernel makes for a
 * surface belongs to freedreno's table from the moment it imports it, and
 * rwa_texture_destroy gives it back. So this file only DESCRIBES the surface (which
 * allocates nothing) and leaves the taking to the library. Taking it here as well would be a
 * second buffer over the same memory on a second user client -- a waste rather than a fault,
 * but closing it would then look like closing the library's.

 *       surface asked for comes back eight-bit and a texture made to the asked-for format
 *       would compute wrong colours into it rather than fail;
 *   the YCbCr formats (500-629)        two planes, and nothing on this port has ever carried
