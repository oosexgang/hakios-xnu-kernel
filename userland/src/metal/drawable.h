/*
 * The drawable side of the Metal driver: an IOSurface of CoreAnimation's as a texture
 * (src/metal/drawable.cpp, part of the driver's C++ core since 1 November; it was C, in
 * src/redwooddrawable.m, until then).
 *
 * Why this is a file of its own. Everything in src/redwoodmetal.m answers Metal; this
 * answers CoreAnimation, and the two meet in exactly one method --
 * -newTextureWithDescriptor:iosurface:plane:. Keeping it apart means the surface bridge can
 * be read, and refused, without reading the 865 answers next to it.
 *
 * That method is NOT only a drawable's, and believing it was cost a wrong sentence in a real
 * boot (docs/metal.md 10.46). Five call sites in QuartzCore send it; one is
 * allocate_drawable_texture, the other four are the window server's Metal compositor
 * (CA::OGL::MetalContext::set_destination_iosurface, ::update_surface, ::get_surface,
 * ::create_surface_from_iosurface). So this file serves "a texture over an IOSurface",
 * whoever asks, and what it can and cannot lay over one is what its refusals are about.
 *
 * What this does NOT contain: a texture class. The object Metal gets back has to be the
 * driver's own RedwoodMetalTexture, because that is what the render encoder binds, so
 * this side stops at `struct rwa_texture *` and src/redwoodmetal.m wraps it. The split is
 * deliberate: the surface, its geometry and every refusal are here, and the Objective-C
 * object stays where its class is.
