/*
 * Does the driver's device object, built as an ordinary library, get through Metal?
 *
 * metal_stubdev proved the contract with classes assembled at runtime. This asks the same
 * question of the real thing: /redwood/lib/libredwoodmetal.dylib, whose RedwoodMetalDevice
 * is declared in source and linked against the private `_OBJC_CLASS_$__MTLDevice`. Whether
 * that symbol binds at all is the first thing this program measures -- if dyld cannot find
 * it, the library does not load and the driver has to go back to building its class at
 * runtime.
 *
 * Then the same three steps as before, and in the same order Metal uses them:
 *   step 4   [class isSubclassOfClass:_MTLDevice]
 *   step 5   [[class alloc] initWithAcceleratorPort:service]
 *   MTLAddDevice (0x181a1875c), then MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice()
 *
 * Discovery is still bypassed, deliberately: no bundle, and the service still has neither
 * MetalPluginName nor MetalPluginClassName, because docs/metal.md section 7 measured what
 * happens when the whole system takes the Metal road with nothing behind it.
 *
 * With --bundle it loads the driver the way Metal's own discovery would -- through NSBundle,
 * out of /redwood/lib/RedwoodMetal.bundle -- instead of dlopen'ing the dylib. That tests the
 * one part of discovery that cannot be reasoned about: whether a flat, unsigned bundle of
 * ours gives up its class to -[NSBundle classNamed:], whose identity test
 * ([NSBundle bundleForClass:cls] == self, 0x1811e0dac) is the thing most likely to refuse.
 * The service is still not given MetalPluginName/MetalPluginClassName, so Metal is not asked
 * to find anything: only the steps are walked, in its order.
 *
 * Run: /redwood/bin/metal_drv_test [--bundle] [LIBRARY [FUNCTION]]   (RC_JOBS=rc.jobs.metaldev)
 *
 * With no arguments it reads /System/Library/VideoDecoders/AV1SW.metallib and offers every
 * function in it to the compiler. With a FUNCTION it compiles and dispatches just that one,
 * which is how a kernel binding nothing but buffers can be picked: the driver has no
 * textures yet, and most of the system's shaders want them.
 *
 * With --picture [SECONDS] it draws the panel instead of a pixel: 64 of Apple's own
 * fragment shaders and Apple's own textured blit, at 1080x2400, put on the screen through
 * the kernel's GPU service so that `./xl screenshot` can take it. See picture_path below;
 * RC_JOBS=rc.jobs.metalpicture runs it.
 *
 * With --time [REPEATS] it measures what all of that COSTS -- a compile, a draw at the
 * panel's own size, a texture, a command buffer, a frame on the screen -- which no mode
 * above it has ever done. See time_path below; RC_JOBS=rc.jobs.metalperf runs it.

/*
 * --draw-attrib: the vertex attribute layout ON THE HARDWARE, through Metal's own API.
 *
 * docs/metal.md 10.44 put MTLVertexDescriptor into the contract and measured it on this
 * machine's softpipe: the offsets, the stride, the formats, the buffer index, the step
 * function and its rate each changed what came back, and the element order proved to be the
 * shader's driver_location order and not Metal's attribute order. What that measurement
 * could NOT touch is the only part made of hardware: the VFD -- Adreno's vertex fetch unit
 * -- which softpipe does not have at all. So three things in it were left as honest
 * negatives, and this mode is here to settle them on the phone:
 *
 *   - the SWAP. MTLVertexFormatUChar4Normalized_BGRA becomes PIPE_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM, and
 *     nothing about the byte order is in the fetch's format field: freedreno puts it in
 *     VFD_DECODE_INSTR.swap, which fd6_vertex_swap() reads off the pipe_format. Measured by
 *     storing the coordinate so that it is only right if the swap happens: the first byte of
 *     the element is ZERO and the coordinate lives in bytes 2 and 1, which the BGRA order
 *     delivers as x and y. Without the swap the shader's x is that zero, every pixel samples
 *     column 0 of the texture, and the x gradient of the picture disappears.
 *   - the INSTANCED bit and STEP_RATE, which are two more fields of the same register
 *     (VFD_DECODE_INSTR.instanced and VFD_DECODE[k].STEP_RATE) and have never been
 *     programmed by this driver. Measured in the picture, because no colour attachment can
 *     show an instance count: the coordinate comes out of a SECOND stream that steps per
 *     instance, so all four vertices of one instance share one coordinate and every pixel
 *     holds ONE texel; per vertex instead, the four vertices get four coordinates and the
 *     picture is a gradient of four texels.
 *   - the PLACEHOLDER element for an attribute gated by a function constant, which 10.44
 *     proved accepted and not fetched: on the host the pipeline for such a module dies
 *     inside softpipe before anything can be drawn with it (the `_lph` variants on the
 *     16-bit narrowing of a `half4` attribute, the `_lpf` ones on `store_scratch`). Here ir3 compiles it, so the question becomes
 *     the one that matters: does the GPU come back. An unconfigured attribute that got NO
 *     element at all would leave an empty VFD slot, and an empty slot fetches from address 0
 *     -- which is the shape of the fault that cost this port a boot in 10.18.
 *
 * And it carries over the thing that makes the host measurement evidence rather than a
 * picture: THE DECOY. The module's own [[attribute(1)]] is air.arg_unused -- nothing reads
 * it -- and this mode configures it anyway, pointing at bytes that hold a different texture
 * coordinate. An element array built in Metal's attribute order, or over all three
 * attributes in order, feeds that layout to attribute 3's fetch: the geometry stays
 * perfectly right and every pixel comes back (100, 200, 300, 400). That is the only wrong
 * answer here that a coverage check could not see.
 *
 * The pipeline is Apple's own code on both sides and out of two libraries, which is a legal
 * Metal pipeline and the shape a real one has: QuartzCore's std_vert0_lpf (position is
 * `mvp_matrix * attribute(0)`, so an IDENTITY matrix in its [[buffer(2)]] makes the position
 * the attribute verbatim, and its [[attribute(3)]] `color` becomes the first varying) over
 * AppleMetalGLRenderer's texturedFragment2DUInt (samples texture 0 at that varying and
 * writes the texel to four RGBA32Uint targets). So the COVERAGE measures attribute 0 and
 * every WORD measures attribute 3: pixel (x, y) must hold the texel its own interpolated
 * coordinate lands in, (100 + x, 200 + y, 300 + x + y, 400), up to the vertical orientation
 * of 10.32 -- both orientations are counted and the one that matched is printed, because
 * which attribute fed the fetch has the same answer either way.

 * --draw-depth: whether a depth test discards anything on the Adreno.
 *
 * Every draw this driver has made ran with no depth attachment and so with depth testing
 * off, which is not a choice anyone made -- it is an absence. This is the measurement that
 * closes it, and it is the same experiment air_metal_test runs on softpipe
 * (tools/mesa/air/air_metal_test.c, --draw-depth), so the two can be put side by side:
 *
 *   - a fragment shader that writes COLOUR, drawn four times. Three with
 *     MTLCompareFunctionLess and depth writes on, at depths 0.5, 0.75 and 0.25, and then
 *     once more at 0.75 with MTLCompareFunctionAlways. The quad is the same quad; what
 *     changes is the depth (through MTLViewport's znear, which is the only thing in Metal
 *     that moves this driver's quad in z) and the bytes of its constant buffer, so a draw
 *     that is not discarded leaves a colour the previous one did not. The colour after the
 *     far draw is the test: unchanged means discarded, and the Always control at that same
 *     depth afterwards says the compare function did it rather than the draw.
 *   - a fragment shader that writes DEPTH -- Apple's texturedFragment2DDepth and
 *     texturedFragment3DDepth -- where the buffer must come back holding what the shader
 *     computed. Those two sample a texture and store channel x to [[depth]], so their
 *     texture is seeded in [0, 1] instead of with air_run's pattern, whose 100.0 would
 *     clamp to the far plane and read exactly like the clear value.
 *
 * Which of the two runs is the pipeline's own answer (-writesDepth, out of the compiler
 * library's rwa_render_info) and not a flag here.

/*
 * --argbuf: MTLArgumentEncoder on the device, and the buffer OFFSET that goes with it.
 *
 * Three measurements, and what each is worth is different, so they are printed apart:
 *
 *  1. THE FUNCTION PATH. -[MTLFunction newArgumentEncoderWithBufferIndex:] is a method of
 *     Metal's own class, and on this port Metal's own implementation cannot work: it asks
 *     the function for its reflection, which asks the device for -compiler, which is a
 *     two-instruction stub answering nil (0x181aac128), and then reports
 *     "bufferIndex %lu does not identify an argument buffer" and returns nil. The driver
 *     answers it instead, through a category, by reading the function's own bitcode. So
 *     what this measures is WHOSE answer came back: Apple's shaders declare no argument
 *     buffer at all (0 of 456 modules, docs/air.md 8.2), so the answer must still be nil
 *     -- but with the driver's own sentence, which names how many sets the function has.
 *     Metal's sentence and the driver's are told apart in the log by "this function
 *     declares".
 *  2. THE DESCRIPTOR PATH, which needs no shader: -[MTLDevice newArgumentEncoderWithArguments:]
 *     with a pointer, a texture and a sampler member. encodedLength must be 24 and
 *     alignment 8 -- 8 bytes per member, which is what Apple's own metadata says a set is
 *     (7 856 of Resident Evil 4's 7 858 sets; the two that differ are both in the one
 *     kernel that builds indirect command buffers and are refused before an encoder could
 *     be made). Then the three members are encoded and the compiler library is asked how
 *     many records it holds for that (buffer, offset), which is the whole of what an
 *     encoder does here.
 *  3. THE BUFFER OFFSET, which is not about argument buffers at all and is the reason this
 *     mode exists tonight: Apple's own clearFragment20 drawn twice, with its 48-byte
 *     constant block at offset 0 of one buffer and at OFFSET 1164 of another. 1164 is the
 *     offset the window server binds its own fragment buffer at, 55 times in one boot,
 *     and until this work every one of those bindings was refused. The two pictures must
 *     be the same four words, and the same four words the host reference gives
 *     (tools/air/metalcheck.py, and draw_path's own `expected`).
 *
 * What is NOT here, said plainly: a DRAW through an argument buffer. That needs a
 * .metallib holding a shader that declares one, and this port has no container writer --
 * Apple's libraries have no sets, and the game's are not something a job list can reach.
 * The draw-through-an-encoder differential is therefore the host's
 * (tools/air/argbufruncheck.sh, on softpipe), and what the device adds is the three above.

 * the same claim: 4x4 says nothing about an attachment a megapixel wide, about a varying
 * that has to interpolate over a thousand pixels instead of four, or about a sampler
 * asked for a texel between two texels rather than the one a coordinate lands on.
 *
 * What is drawn, in three bands that together are exactly the panel (1080x2400 -- the
 * size the kernel prints at boot: "display 1125x2436 on a panel of 1080x2400"):
 *
 *   rows 0..1103      64 of Apple's own clearFragment shaders, one per square of an 8x8
 *                     mosaic of 135x138 tiles. The number in the name is a mask of two
 *                     bits per render target -- 0 none, 1 float4, 2 int4, 3 uint4 -- so
 *                     the 64 numbered 4k+1 are exactly those that write a float4 to
 *                     target 0, and each reads that float4 out of the constant buffer at
 *                     index 14 (its ClearFragmentInput is { float4, int4, uint4 } and
 *                     every float4 output is the first field). Each square is given a
 *                     colour of its own in that buffer, so a square is one shader's
 *                     answer and the mosaic is 64 of them side by side.
 *   rows 1104..1751   Apple's texturedVertex2D + texturedFragment2DFloat -- the pipeline
 *                     AppleMetalGLRenderer blits a texture with -- sampling an 8x8
 *                     texture over the whole 1080x648 attachment through a LINEAR
 *                     sampler. Every pixel of it is an interpolated texture coordinate
 *                     and a filtered texel, which is the one thing a 4x4 draw over a
 *                     constant coordinate cannot show at all (docs/metal.md 10.32).
 *   rows 1752..2399   the same draw with a NEAREST sampler. Blocky where the band above
 *                     is smooth, and that difference is the sampler state reaching the
 *                     hardware; it is also the band in which every pixel is exactly one
 *                     texel, so every pixel of it can be counted.
 *
 * The pixels reach the panel through the kernel's own GPU service -- kRedwoodShow,
 * iokit/Kernel/RedwoodGPU.cpp, the selector src/gl_test.c already puts its triangle on the
 * screen with -- and that is what `./xl screenshot` reads. Said plainly because it
 * matters: THE PRESENTATION IS A COPY IN THE KERNEL AND IS NOT METAL'S. What is claimed
 * is that every one of the 2 592 000 pixels handed over was computed by this driver's
 * Metal pipelines on the Adreno. Nothing here is drawn by the processor -- no border, no
 * label, no background -- so that the claim needs no exceptions.
 *
 * And the numbers beside it, because "it looks right" is not a measurement:
 *
 *   - the mosaic: every pixel of every tile against the colour that tile's buffer named,
 *     and every one of the 256 (shader, render target) pairs against what the shader's
 *     own name says it writes -- a target the name does not list must still hold the
 *     clear, which is the half a chart of colours alone would not say. Integer targets
 *     are not checked and are counted as not checked;
 *   - the nearest band: every pixel against the texel the sampler must have returned for
 *     it, floor(x / 135) and floor(y / 81);
 *   - the linear band: the 64 pixels that fall exactly on a texel centre. The band is 8
 *     texels over 1080 columns and 8 over 648 rows, so the scales are 135 and 81, both
 *     ODD -- and that is why a pixel centre can coincide with a texel centre at all
 *     (pixel p is texel centre i when p = s*i + (s-1)/2), which leaves the filter no

 * four minutes. The GPU was not wedged -- the heartbeat went on reading sensors and the run
 * ended cleanly -- and the driver refuses a draw the GPU does not finish with a sentence
 * and a status (that is how Apple's two [[depth]] shaders are known to hang it,
 * logs/094810-run.log: "status 5, the GPU did not finish the draw"). So a silent stop is
 * NOT a hung dispatch, and the suspects are all on this side of the fence.
 *
 * Everything here is therefore built to name the step rather than to survive it:
 *
 *   - every step says its own name BEFORE it starts, flushed. On the way this stage takes,
 *     nothing printed unless something failed, so the stall had the whole stage to hide in;
 *   - between the mosaic and the textured pipeline there is now a PROBE, which is the
 *     cheapest way to cut the suspect space in half in one boot. It draws
 *     clearFragment01 -- the shader the mosaic has already drawn 64 times, with the
 *     generated vertex stage, no texture, no sampler and no vertex buffer -- into the
 *     band-sized attachments, and reads first one pixel and then the whole 1080x648 back.
 *     Three different things can stall in there and each has its own line, so the boot
 *     says which: making four 1080x648 BGRA8Unorm render targets, drawing into one, and
 *     reading one back. If the probe gets through, none of those is the cause and what is
 *     left is Apple's vertex stage, the sampled texture and the sampler;
 *   - nothing here stores to [[depth]], which is the one thing known to hang this GPU.
 *
 * And the mosaic is already on the panel before any of it runs, so a stall now costs the
 * bands and not the screenshot.

 * ==========================================================================================
 * --time: WHAT THIS DRIVER COSTS, ON THE PHONE, IN MICROSECONDS
 * ==========================================================================================
 *
 * Everything above this line answers "is it right". Nothing above it has ever answered "how
 * long" -- not a dispatch, not a draw, not a frame -- and the two questions fail differently:
 * a wrong draw says so in a pixel, a slow draw says nothing at all. The acceptance test for
 * this driver is a game, and a game is bought with time, so this mode measures the four
 * things a frame is actually made of and prints each with what would make it wrong.
 *
 * WHERE THE TIME GOES HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT WHERE AN APPLICATION EXPECTS IT.
 *
 * -[RedwoodMetalCommandBuffer commit] does the work (docs/metal.md 10.13). The encoder only
 * RECORDS; commit walks the recorded list calling rwa_render_draw / rwa_dispatch, and each of
 * those flushes the Gallium context and WAITS ON ITS OWN FENCE before returning
 * (tools/mesa/air/air_metal.c, finish_or_say_why with required = true). Three consequences,
 * and the mode is built around them:
 *
 *   1. encoding is nearly free and measures nothing an application cares about;
 *   2. -commit is the whole frame -- our translation, the submission, the GPU's execution and
 *      the wait for it -- one draw after another, with NO overlap between processor and GPU.
 *      So a frame's cost is the SUM of its draws and not the maximum of two pipelines;
 *   3. -waitUntilCompleted has nothing left to wait for and must measure ~0. That is not a
 *      hole to paper over: it is the check that the split is where this comment says it is,
 *      which is why it is measured and printed instead of assumed. A -waitUntilCompleted that
 *      is NOT ~0 means this comment is out of date and every other number here is mis-split.
 *
 * ONE DRAW IS ONE RENDER PASS IS ONE SUBMISSION. rwa_render_draw creates the surfaces, sets
 * the framebuffer, clears, draws, flushes and fences, then tears the framebuffer down again
 * (air_metal.c around 4124-4346). So eight Metal draws into one encoder are eight kernel
 * submissions and eight passes over the attachment, not one -- which is exactly why this mode
 * times one draw per command buffer AND eight, and prints the marginal cost of a draw
 * separately from the cost of a command buffer.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, AND WHY THESE AND NOT OTHERS
 *
 *   the clock itself      every number below is this clock's; printed first so that nothing
 *                         within a few times its floor is read as a measurement.
 *   a pipeline state      an AIR -> NIR -> ir3 compile inside -newRenderPipelineStateWith-
 *                         Descriptor:, with NO cache anywhere (air_metal.c: "One compiled
 *                         state, not a cache"). Measured cold (the process's first, which also
 *                         pays for whatever the compiler sets up once) and warm, the same
 *                         function again and then different functions -- because if the same
 *                         function is much cheaper the second time, something IS caching and
 *                         the warm number is not a compile.
 *   a draw                at three sizes: 4x4 (every earlier number in this file), 1080x648
 *                         (the picture's band, so this is comparable with logs/140340) and
 *                         1080x2400, the panel. A 4x4 quad says nothing about a frame: that is
 *                         the whole reason the big sizes are here.
 *   with and without the clear   the same attachments drawn through two render passes that
 *                         differ in ONE field, loadAction. Every draw in a pass whose
 *                         loadAction is Clear re-clears the attachment in this driver
 *                         (redwoodmetal.m copies _clears into every recorded draw), and an
 *                         application clears once a frame, so the two have to be told apart
 *                         before a per-draw cost means anything.
 *   a texture upload      -replaceRegion: of the whole attachment-sized image, in MB/s: what
 *                         streaming a texture costs.
 *   a readback            -getBytes: of the same. No game does this; it is here because every
 *                         verifying mode in this file does it, so its cost has to be
 *                         attributable and NOT mistaken for the draw's.
 *   command buffers/s     how many the queue sustains with no work in them at all: the floor
 *                         under any frame rate, and the one number that would catch a
 *                         regression of the 64-slot semaphore bug (10.33) as a slowdown
 *                         rather than as a hang.
 *   the present           -getBytes: of the finished attachment plus the kernel's kRedwoodShow
 *                         row copy. NOT Metal's, and said so where it is printed -- but a
 *                         frame that is never shown is not a frame, and this is the only way
 *                         this port has to show one, so a frame rate that leaves it out is a
 *                         frame rate for a game nobody can see.
 *
 * HOW OUR COST IS SEPARATED FROM THE GPU's, AND WHERE IT CANNOT BE
 *
 * Three ways, in order of how much they can be trusted. The first did not exist when this mode
 * was written and was added because the other two were not enough (docs/metal.md 10.43):
 *
 *   (0) ASK THE KERNEL. Request kRedwoodGPUWorked (0x7d) on RedwoodGPU answers
 *       redwood_gpu_worked()'s three numbers -- the microseconds the 3D core worked, on how
 *       many submissions, and the histogram -- taken off CP_ALWAYS_ON_COUNTER. Reading resets
 *       them, so each case is bracketed by two reads and gets the core's own time for its own
 *       draws. An older kernel answers kIOReturnUnsupported and the mode says in words that
 *       the GPU's side is not measured, rather than printing a zero.
 *
 * and the two that were there first, which still run because they need nothing of the kernel:
 *
 *   (a) BY SUBTRACTION, in this process, no boot argument needed. The 4x4 case and the
 *       1080x2400 case emit the same commands, bind the same state and make the same number
 *       of submissions; what differs is the number of pixels. So the 4x4 per-draw median is
 *       our cost plus the round trip, and the increase at the bigger sizes is the GPU's --
 *       its fill and the bandwidth of one pass over the attachment. This attributes nothing
 *       it cannot see: it says "fixed" and "proportional to area", not "ours" and "theirs".
 *   (b) BY THE KERNEL'S OWN COUNTER, which needs the boot argument gpu_log=1 and a log to
 *       read afterwards. bsd/dev/redwood_adreno.c times every submission off the GPU's
 *       always-on counter and writes "tl: q <fence> took <us>" per submission; RedwoodGPU.cpp
 *       prints, every five seconds in which something was submitted, "the GPU worked N us on
 *       each of M" with a histogram. Those lines land in the same run log as these, so the
 *       reader subtracts. This mode cannot print them itself and does not pretend to: what it
 *       prints instead is HOW MANY submissions each case made, so the kernel's M can be
 *       matched to a case instead of guessed at.
 *
 * And one number that cannot be split at all, said so rather than attributed: the cold
 * pipeline. It contains the compiler's one-time setup and one compile and nothing separates
 * them from inside the process; what can be said is that the second compile no longer pays
 * whatever the first did, and the difference between the two is printed.

 * THE GPU'S OWN SIDE, ASKED OF THE KERNEL INSTEAD OF READ OUT OF THE LOG.
 *
 * The first run of this mode could only subtract one case from another and point at the
 * kernel's `tl: q <fence> took <us>` lines for the rest -- and that turned out to be the
 * weakest part of it: those lines number every submission on the machine, this test is not the
 * only thing submitting, and aligning 1285 of them to four cases by eye is exactly the kind of
 * arithmetic that produces a confident wrong answer (docs/metal.md 10.43 shows the three
 * populations it did produce, and the ambiguity in their boundaries).
 *
 * So the kernel now hands the numbers over: request kRedwoodGPUWorked (0x7d) on RedwoodGPU
 * answers redwood_gpu_worked()'s three outputs -- the microseconds the 3D core itself worked,
 * on how many submissions, and how many of those were under 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 ms --
 * measured off CP_ALWAYS_ON_COUNTER at 19.2 ticks a microsecond (bsd/dev/redwood_adreno.c).
 * Reading it RESETS it, which is what makes bracketing a case possible: read once to zero,
 * draw, read again.
 *
 * Two things this must never do, and both are why it is written this way:
 *
 *   - IT MUST BE OPTIONAL. An older kernel answers 0x7d with "request 0x7d is not known here"
 *     and kIOReturnUnsupported, and a zero from that is indistinguishable from a GPU that did
 *     no work. So the first failure disables it for the run and says so in words; it never
 *     prints a zero that could be read as a measurement.
 *   - IT MUST SAY THAT IT TAKES THE NUMBERS AWAY. The kernel's own five-second report in
 *     RedwoodGPU.cpp shares these counters, so a boot that runs this mode leaves gaps in those
 *     lines. That is expected rather than a fault, and it is printed once.

 *
 *   - ONE COMMAND BUFFER A FRAME. An application that makes several pays the command buffer's
 *     cost several times.
 *   - NO OVERLAP, which is not an assumption but this driver's behaviour: rwa_render_draw
 *     waits on its own fence inside -commit, so the processor and the GPU take turns and a
 *     frame is the SUM of its draws. A driver that pipelined would reach the maximum of the
 *     two instead of the sum, and that is the single biggest difference between these numbers
 *     and what the same hardware can do.
 *   - EVERY DRAW COVERS THE WHOLE PANEL in the upper bracket and sixteen pixels in the lower
 *     one. A real scene is between them and nearer the lower end, so the two brackets are
 *     printed and the middle is not invented.
 *   - THE PRESENT IS PAID ONCE A FRAME, and it is not Metal's: this port shows a frame by
 *     reading the attachment back and handing it to the kernel's row copy. A game that never
 *     shows anything saves it.
 *   - NOTHING ELSE RUNS. These were measured with the panel to ourselves; with iOS's own
 *     daemons alive the GPU and the one core doing all this are shared.

/*
 * WHAT EVERY CLASS OF THE DRIVER OWES, COUNTED ON EVERY RUN.
 *
 * 10.17 counted this for the device object and found nothing owed; the objects below it
 * were never counted, and the first boot in which iOS's own daemons could reach them
 * (logs/130132-run.log, metal=1 with launchd alive) answered why that mattered: 88 aborts
 * in a hundred seconds, all of them -[RedwoodMetalCommandQueue setGPUPriority:] and
 * -setCompletionQueue:, each followed by launchd restarting the daemon.
 *
 * Counting them is not simply "ask the runtime", for two reasons, and both of them are the
 * reason this code is longer than the one loop it replaces:
 *
 *  1. THE PROTOCOL MAY NOT BE IN THE PROCESS. MTLDevice and MTLDeviceSPI are declared in
 *     Metal.framework, so every process that asks Metal has them. MTLCommandQueueSPI,
 *     MTLCommandBufferSPI, MTLRenderCommandEncoderSPI, MTLComputeCommandEncoderSPI,
 *     MTLRenderPipelineStateSPI, MTLComputePipelineStateSPI and even the PUBLIC
 *     MTLCommandQueue and MTLRenderCommandEncoder are declared in AGXMetalA11.bundle --
 *     the GPU bundle of a phone whose GPU is Apple's, which never loads here. So
 *     objc_getProtocol returns NULL for them and `protocol_copyMethodDescriptionList` has
 *     nothing to copy. Their required methods are compiled in below, read out of this
 *     phone's own shared cache by tools/metal/protometh.py; where the runtime does have a
 *     protocol it is asked instead, and the two counts are compared out loud.
 *
 *  2. AN ENTRY IN A METHOD TABLE IS NOT BEHAVIOUR (docs/metal.md 10.1). Apple writes an
 *     abstract method as a real entry whose body is [self doesNotRecognizeSelector:_cmd];
 *     `respondsToSelector:` answers YES for it and the abort when it is called names the
 *     RECEIVER -- our class -- so in the log it is indistinguishable from a method that was
 *     never written. _MTLCommandEncoder has 27 such entries for the mesh and object shader
