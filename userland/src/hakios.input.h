/*
 * /dev/hakios-touch: touch samples on their way from whoever produces them to the
 * program that turns them into HID events for the window server.
 *
 * Darwin expects touches from Apple's multitouch driver through IOHIDFamily; neither exists
 * here. Instead a producer -- a kernel driver for a real touch controller or for an emulated
 * pointer, or a user program replaying a script -- posts samples, and code of ours running
 * inside backboardd reads them and synthesizes the events. Both sides use the same record.
 *
 *   write(): one or more records (time is ignored; the kernel stamps them)
 *   read():  blocks until there is at least one record, returns as many whole ones as fit
