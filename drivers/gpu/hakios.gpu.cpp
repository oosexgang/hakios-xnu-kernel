/*
 * HakiosGPU: the phone's Adreno for programs to draw with.
 *
 * drivers/gpu/hakios.adreno.c wakes the GPU and, with boot-arg adreno_keep=1, keeps it on and
 * starts this service. A program that opens it speaks the interface of Linux's msm DRM driver,
 * the one Mesa's freedreno knows: every request of that interface is a call of the user client
 * with the request's number as the selector and the request's structure passed in and back
 * (userland: tools/mesa/hakios-drm, which stands in for libdrm inside Mesa). What Linux does
 * with mmap() on the device is the client memory of the type that is the buffer's handle.
 *
 * What there is of the interface is what freedreno uses to draw: parameters, buffers (made,
 * told their address in the GPU's address space, mapped, given back), submission of command
 * buffers, and waiting for one to be done. A buffer is wired kernel memory entered into the 3D
 * core's SMMU context; it is zero when made, and write-combined: what the program writes goes to
 * memory, where the GPU reads it, and not into this processor's cache (as Linux maps them for
 * freedreno; boot-arg gpu_cached=1 makes them ordinary memory, pushed out of the cache whenever
 * the GPU is given something to do: see submit()).
 *
 * One request is not Linux's: a buffer that is the memory of an IOSurface (surfaceBuffer()), for
 * drawing into what the display shows and for reading pictures where other programs have drawn
 * them. Linux hands such memory around as file descriptors; here it has a name already. That
 * memory is ordinary, cached memory, which everybody else reads and writes as such.
 *
 * Not here yet: interrupts (waiting is asking again five times a millisecond), more than one
 * program's worth of care (every client's buffers are in the one address space; a client that
 * goes takes its own away), recovery of a GPU that has stopped answering (it is reported, see
 * hakios_gpu_report(), and stays stopped), fences and buffers as file descriptors.
