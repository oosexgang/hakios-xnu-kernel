/*
 * The GPU of the POCO X5 Pro (redwood), an Adreno 642L, woken step by step up to a picture that
 * it fills and the panel shows. Every address below belongs to this phone, and nothing here is
 * touched unless a boot-arg asks for it.
 *
 * Boot-arg gpu=1, on the phone and with the GPU's firmware in the small image: the GPU is
 * started while the system starts and kept for the window server to draw with (the service
 * RedwoodGPU; "the GPU kept on" below). Should a step fail, one line says which, and the system
 * draws in software as it does without the boot-arg.
 *
 * The steps are how this was found out, and they stay for looking: how much of the GPU a kernel
 * under Qualcomm's hypervisor may reach was not known, and an access the hypervisor does not
 * like ends the run, at once or a quarter of a minute later, and often without a word. adreno=N
 * performs steps 1 to N and stops; a step says what it is about to touch before it touches it
 * and what it found after, reads come before writes, and a step that does not find what it
 * needs ends the sequence instead of going on blind.
 *
 *   1  reads   what feeds the GPU from outside: its clocks in the global clock controller, and
 *              the names RPMh knows its supplies by
 *   2  reads   the fuses that say which GPU this is
 *   3  reads   the GPU's own clock controller, as the boot loader left it
 *   4  writes  the "CX" power switch on: the half of the GPU block that is not the 3D core --
 *              the power management processor ("GMU"), the bus interface, the GPU's SMMU
 *   5  writes  the clocks of that half on, and measures with the SoC's frequency counter whether
 *              they run: the control register of one of them does not say
 *   6  reads   the first words from the GPU block itself: registers of the GMU (among them a
 *              counter that should be seen counting) and of the bus interface
 *   7  reads   the GMU's own channel to RPMh
 *   8  reads   the SMMU in front of the GPU: its ID registers, and which stream goes where
 *   9  reads   that SMMU's first translation context
 *  10  writes  two words into the GMU's memory and reads them back: the way its firmware goes
 *  11  asks    TrustZone questions that pass no memory: whether it takes calls from this kernel,
 *              and which firmware images it says it authenticates
 *  12  asks    TrustZone to check the signature of the GPU's "zap shader", the signed image
 *              without which the 3D core stays locked in secure mode: its header goes from the
 *              small image (fw/a660_zap.mdt) into memory of ours that TrustZone is pointed at
 *  13  writes  page tables for the memory the GMU's firmware asks for, and the SMMU: a
 *              translation context with those tables, and the GMU's requests sent through it
 *  14  writes  the GMU's firmware (fw/a660_gmu.bin) into its own memory and into that memory
 *  15  writes  the GMU's configuration, and lets its processor out of reset: the firmware runs
 *  16  writes  the GMU's connection to RPMh; starts its message queues ("HFI")
 *  17  talks   to the GMU: the tables it needs, and the request to power the 3D core, whose
 *              registers are then read
 *  18  writes  the 3D core's translation context, with its ring and its microcode
 *              (fw/a660_sqe.fw) in it
 *  19  asks    TrustZone to load the zap shader (and first to give up the one a kernel before
 *              this one may have left; the stop at the end of a run asks for that too)
 *  20  writes  the 3D core's registers; starts its command processor and gives it its first
 *              command
 *  21  commands the 3D core out of secure mode, and to write a word into a page of ours
 *  22  commands a picture filled with three colours, and shows it on the panel
 * When the steps are over, what they started is stopped again, in reverse, and the CX half
 * switched off: nothing of the GPU block outlives the run (its SMMU contexts point into this
 * kernel's memory), and the next one starts from what the phone's own start leaves.
 *
 * The firmware is the phone's own, from /vendor/firmware of its Android. There is no register that holds the chip ID (0x06030500,
 * "qcom,chipid" in the device tree): the fuses of step 2 are all the hardware says about
 * itself, and the GMU's version is a property of its firmware.
 *
 * More boot-args:
 *   adreno_only=K      step K alone (what steps 6 to 10 need, they check for themselves: within
 *                      one session of the loader, power and clocks stay as an earlier run left them)
 *   adreno_skip=MASK   leave out the steps whose bits are set (bit 2 = step 2)
 *   adreno_pause=MS    how long the newest step waits after announcing a group of accesses
 *                      (default 2200). The loader, watching from another core (bootcpu=N), writes
 *                      the end of our log to storage every two seconds, and after a silent reset
 *                      that note is all there is.
 *   adreno_fine=1      the newest step waits like that before every single access
 *   adreno_keep=1      with adreno=21: the GPU is not stopped again but kept for the system to draw
 *                      with, through the service RedwoodGPU (see "the GPU kept on" below); it is
 *                      given back when the run ends (adreno_dirty=1: left as a panic leaves it)
 *   adreno_speed=N     step 17 asks the GMU for the 3D core's Nth speed: 1 315 MHz, 2 450 MHz,
 *                      3 550 MHz (the default: the most this phone's GPU is rated for)
 *   adreno_blind=1     step 20 starts the command processor with its microcode nowhere, and
 *   adreno_stream1=N   step 18 leaves the core's second stream out (0) or gives it an empty
 *                      context of its own (2): what the SMMU then records shows what the core
 *                      asks for. With 0 and the microcode in place the phone resets.
 *   adreno_watch=S     after the last step, say once a second for S seconds (default 20) that
 *                      the machine is still alive, and what was written last
 *   adreno_return=1    when all is over, go back to the loader instead of starting the system
 *   display_probe=1    before any step: read what the firmware left the display controller
 *                      doing (display_probe() below; two clocks are turned on, nothing else written)
 * The system does not go on starting until all of this is over, so that the end of the log is
 * ours; the touch screen driver's start would talk across it (leave touchscreen=1 out).
 *
 * Addresses are from the phone's own device tree ("dt:" below; the nodes qcom,kgsl-3d0@3d00000,
 * qcom,gmu@3d69000, clock-controller@3d90000, qcom,gdsc@3d9106c, kgsl-smmu@3da0000,
 * qfprom@780000), register layouts from Linux, where SC7280 is this SoC: drivers/clk/qcom/
 * {gcc,gpucc}-sc7280.c, gdsc.c, clk-rcg2.c, drivers/gpu/drm/msm/adreno/a6xx_gmu.c with

 * cmd-db.c, drivers/firmware/qcom/qcom_scm{,-smc}.c, drivers/soc/qcom/mdt_loader.c. The phone's
 * vendor kernel agrees on every offset used here, and is the only source for the frequency counter.

 * told where the image will be -- the two pages the device tree reserves for it
 * (reserved-memory gpu_micro_code@8b71a000, the zap-shader node's memory-region) --, the image's
 * one segment (the file a660_zap.b02, relocatable: at the start of that memory) is put there,
 * and TrustZone is asked to authenticate it and run it. The vendor's driver does this before it
 * starts the 3D core's command processor (a6xx_rb_start: a6xx_microcode_load), Linux after;
 * this phone's own order is kept. Once that is done the memory is TrustZone's, and nothing
 * here can see whether it is so; to write there again would be the end of the run. Our kernels
 * come and go without the phone restarting, so a kernel leaves no zap shader behind: when it
 * gives the GPU back it has TrustZone take the shader away again (gpu_block_stop(); the
 * vendor's driver does the same when it is unloaded: kgsl_zap_shader_unload), and the next one
 * loads it as if the phone had just started. A kernel that did not end in order cannot have
 * done that. So the same request is made here first: TrustZone answers it with success whether
 * it had a shader or not, and hands the memory back cleared (it then reads as zeroes). Should
 * it ever refuse, and then refuse the header or the place too, that is taken to mean that it
 * has a zap shader from before and keeps it: it is used as it is, and nothing is written.
 * (Step 21 is what tells whether the 3D core gets out of secure mode with it.) There was a
 * boot-arg adreno_zap=0 for the second and later runs of a started phone; nothing reads it now.
