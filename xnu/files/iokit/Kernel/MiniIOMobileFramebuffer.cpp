 * Switch Metal's own device discovery on, from user space: IORegistryEntrySetCFProperties() with
 * MetalPluginName and MetalPluginClassName. Metal reads the first (getMetalPluginClassForService,
 * 0x181a39ba4), builds "/System/Library/Extensions/" + it + ".bundle", opens that with NSBundle
 * and takes the class the second names; with the first missing it returns nil before it even
 * reads the second, and that single `cbz` is where the chain breaks on this port today.
 *
 * This method is the only thing that was in the way. IORegistryEntry::setProperties is
 * "return kIOReturnUnsupported" (IORegistryEntry.cpp) and IOService does not override it; the
 * MAC check in front of the call has no policy to ask, because this kernel registers no iokit
 * hook (bsd/kern/kern_minimac.c); and this service carries no property whitelist.
 *
 * Why it is gated on a boot-arg, which is a measured risk and not caution in general
 * (docs/metal.md 10.14): the conditions Metal puts on a device object are asserts, not soft
 * refusals (10.2-10.3). A process that asks Metal and is handed a half-made device does not
 * degrade to another renderer -- it aborts ("Assertion failed: ([self
 * conformsToProtocol:@protocol(MTLDeviceSPI)])", "failed assertion _limits.maxColorAttachments
 * > 0"), and an aborting daemon is restarted by launchd, which is a loop. Published instead at
 * registerService() time, the properties would exist before launchd, backboardd and SpringBoard
 * are born, so each of the three would take the Metal road on its first call, with nobody left
 * to read the log. Behind a boot-arg, a machine that has them is a machine booted on purpose to
 * have them, and the first such boot is meant to be RC=rc.ios, where launchd is never born.
 *
 * An empty string removes a property rather than setting it. That is the way out of the loop
 * above without a reboot: the properties live only in the registry, so processes started after
 * they are gone go back to the software road.
 *
 * Everything else is refused, and refused whole, before anything is set: every process on the
 * machine can reach this method and the only thing it exists for is this one switch.
