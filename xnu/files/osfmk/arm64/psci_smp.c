/*
 * More than one processor on generic (non-Apple) ARMv8 boards.
 *
 * On Apple hardware the other cores are powered up by closed drivers. Here
 * the firmware does it, through the standard power interface of ARM systems
 * (PSCI): CPU_ON starts a core at an address of the caller's choice, CPU_OFF
 * stops the calling core for good. The address we give is the kernel's own
 * reset vector (LowResetVectorBase in start.s), so that a new core takes the
 * path Apple's cores take: it finds its cpu data by its MPIDR, turns the MMU
 * on and comes out in arm_init_cpu(). The calls are made with SMC or, under
 * a hypervisor that implements them itself, with HVC; the boot loader says
 * which (/chosen/psci-method).
 *
 * The platform expert (iokit/Kernel/GenericARMPE.cpp) registers the cores of
 * the device tree and starts them here, one after the other. Signals between
 * processors are interrupts of the GIC (gic_v3_irq.c).
 *
 * A new core begins with its MMU and caches off, and what it reads then it
 * reads from memory. On real hardware that is not the same as what the
 * running processors see: under Qualcomm's hypervisor (the phone this was
 * written for) a line that is dirty in another core's cache is simply not
 * there yet. QEMU has no cache and shows none of this. So before CPU_ON
 * everything that core will read before its MMU is on is written back to
 * memory (psci_smp_start_cpu()), and what it writes in that state is read
 * only after throwing away the reader's cached copy.
 *
 * The other half is the way out. The kernel ends by returning to the boot
 * loader (loader_return.c), and the loader gets back only what it started:
 * one core, the boot processor's. psci_smp_stop_others() makes every other
 * core switch itself off first, wherever it is.
